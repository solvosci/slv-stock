* See if we can find a way to assign the difference, (in order to equalize ..)
  if it is positive to the partner who has the least amount in purchases for
  that product in the month
  and if it is negative to the one who has more purchases

* It remains pending if this distribution will only be made based
  on a field on the product or always.
  It is not distributed if there is stock of product in the "exit" warehouse,
  so products that are not produced must have stock to confirm the sales order.
