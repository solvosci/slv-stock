Features summary:

* A history average price can be maintained for a certain category
  by product, warehouse and date. Every date is treated as a closed
  valuation block. In this records a stock summary and its correspondent
  valuation at date is provided, replacing Stock Valuation Layer usage
  for stock-at-date determination.
* As per-warehouse valuation is provided, internal transfers between
  warehouse generate valuations.
* Custom date operations are supported, so a general avarage prices
  and valuations recalculation is provided when a past stock operation is
  marked as done.
* Prices base are purchase incomings and internal transfer inputs.

Usage
=====

For a certain product category,

* Set cost method to "Manual".
* Set Warehouse Valuation.

Then, for later stock moves, in the Reports menu for Inventory
Product Average prices, stock and stock valuation at date values
can be found.

Also, an Inventory At Date standalone menu is available through
a date and warehouse selection wizard. This functionality replaces the
"Inventory at Date" button in Inventory Report.
