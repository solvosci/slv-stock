Enables passing a custom date for a stock move when move is marked as done.

In order to use it, when ``_action_done`` for stock.move is called, a 
``stock_move_custom_date`` variable should exist in ``context``. In that case,
current date for ``stock.move`` and ``stock.move.line`` records will be used.

PLEASE USE IT WITH CAUTION. No checks are passed, no verifications are made.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This code could be substituted for a more agressive but maybe more secure one,
replacing current ``_action_done`` methods for ``stock.move`` and
``stock.move.line`` models with a code copy, changing 
``fields.Datetime.now()`` for the desired date.
